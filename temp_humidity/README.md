### Display Room Temprature and Humidity on an I2C LCD 1602

**WARNING:** I am a smoothbrain in this domain. I have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to microcontrollers or micropython or arduino-type things. Don't take any of this as advice, or even good practice. I'm just having some fun with whatever came with the SunFounder ESP32 Starter Kit.

Requires [micropython-i2c-lcd ](https://github.com/brainelectronics/micropython-i2c-lcd/tree/main) to run. I used Thonny to install from PyPi, and it seemed to set in quite well on my CH340C with no extra configuration needed on my part.
